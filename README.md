# linecount
A basic C program to count lines and bytes in a file. Like GNU wc, but with less functionality.

I don't consider myself a programmer, and I understand code that actual programmers write about as much as a kid learning Python understands assembly language. I was looking at the source code for GNU `wc`, and because I had no idea how it worked or what any individual line did, I figured I would write a program that does basically the same thing with what I do know. This is the result.
